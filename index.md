## US-Intl Keyboard Layout for Android External Keyboards

This project is a keyboard layout providing the [US-International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY#US-International) (with dead keys) keyboard layout for use with external keyboards attached to Android devices.
The layout itself is in a KCM file, and the rest of the project is the scaffolding necessary to provide the layout as an input receiver and build everything as an APK.
